# ARPING
ARPING is a tool that lists all devices answering to ARP requests on the local network.

Optionally, you can also have it try to perform a reverse-lookup to print the hostname of found devices (-n, --name).

## Usage
```bash
./arping.py

Optional arguments:
    -h, --help   Show this help message and exit
    -n, --name   Try to perform a reverse-lookup on found IP addresses
```
